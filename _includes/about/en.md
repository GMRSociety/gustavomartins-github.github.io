Hello, I'm Gustavo Martins Ribeiro, (also known as lxgustxl). I am a Software Engineering student at [UnB (University of Bras√≠lia)](https://www.unb.br/) - [FGA Campus (Gama College)](https://fga.unb.br/) and I love studying topics related to the area, such as Artificial Intelligence, Database Systems and Agile Development.

Currently I have experience, mainly, with object-oriented systems (Python & Java), game development using the Pygame library, Programming Paradigms, Software Requirements, Human-Computer Interaction, Data Structures, Software Architecture and Design, among many others. other topics belonging to the universe of **Software Engineering**.

Finally, out of curiosity, my favorite programming language is C, which I have trained in since the beginning of my graduation process until today. Check out some projects I participated in below.
